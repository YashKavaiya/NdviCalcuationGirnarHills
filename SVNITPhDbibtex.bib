abstract = {Rainfall variability has historically been a major cause of food insecurities and famines in Ethiopia. Remote sensing is an essential instrument to identify and monitor the environmental problems including droughts. Time series satellite data from remote sensing images (at high temporal and medium spatial to low spatial resolution) can assist vegetation condition and rainfall variability for monitoring. It provides timely and key information about the relationships between rainfall and vegetation condition in near-real time over large areas. Rainfall estimates reveal different statistical data distribution as compared to vegetation indices. These indices have to be taken into account in the computation of anomaly indicators. This study investigated the temporal relationships between rainfall and vegetation condition for eight zones of Amhara Region, Ethiopia between 2001 and 2016. To address the needs of drought monitoring, the Standardized Precipitation Index was included in the study. The results indicated that vegetation conditions have related to rainfall, and it has been shown moderate and severe droughts in 2009 and 2015 for different zones. Besides, the finding has shown that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an effective indicator of vegetation condition, and seasonal monitoring and analysis should be taken into consideration when monitoring drought with the NDVI.}
